** Installation
   Much information can be found at the [[https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/emacs/download.html][GNU Emacs Download & Installation]] page. Upgrading to the newest/current version of emacs (if emacs comes preinstalled on ones operating system) will give the best user experience, and it is advised to do so as soon as possible. Here are several resources to assist you as you start or continue your journey with emacs.

*** Linux
    Use your favorite Linux package manager (e.g. apt, dnf, yum, pacman, etc) or build from [[https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/][source]]. Typically, either a relatively recent version of emacs or no instance of emacs will be on a default install of one's Linux [[https://distrowatch.com][distribution]].

*** macOS
    Use [[https://brew.sh][Homebrew]] or [[https://www.macports.org][MacPorts]] to install emacs with a package manager. Also, consider [[https://emacsformacosx.com][Emacs for Mac OS X]] and the Homebrew [[https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus][Emacs Plus]] formula for installation candidates. The preinstalled version of emacs on a default macOS install is quite [[https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/229669/update-emacs-that-comes-with-os-x][old]]. For an optimal emacs experience, upgrading to a newer version is highly recommended.

*** Windows
    Download emacs from a GNU Mirror listed on the GNU Emacs Download & Installation page, and/or use the [[https://www.msys2.org][MSYS2]] pacman manager means by which emacs can be installed in Windows. Another option is to install emacs via the [[https://chocolatey.org/packages/Emacs][Chocolatey]] Windows package manager. A default install of Windows does not contain emacs.

*** Alternative
    The following resources can be used to build emacs in various environments-- e.g. containerized [[https://www.docker.com][docker]] builds, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration][continuous integration]], building various versions of emacs, etc.

* Contributing

*Your contributions are always welcome!* Please submit a pull request or create an issue to add a new package, library or software to the list.

Before contributing, please read this tiny guideline:

** The Order of Items

*Please don't rearrange the package ordering without any reason!* The items should be sorted by its popularity ( /roughly, because it's impossible to have a precise standard./ e.g. _most people would use it_; _recommended for every newbie_...), instead of your personal preference.

For example, =Evil= is obviously not a package that every Emacser needs. So please don't move it onto the top of its category.

In contrast, if you think a package is recommended for every Emacser (especially for a newbie), just place it at a higher place in the list.

** Emacs Built-In Packages
If a package is available in the latest version of Emacs, please remember to add a =[built-in]= tag in the front of the description.

** Generate "Table of Contents"

It is recommended to install [[https://melpa.org/#/toc-org][toc-org]] that will update the Table Of Contents for
you automatically on each save. It will also give you a convenient navigation -
if you press =C-c C-o= (=org-open-at-point=) when the point is on the entry in
the Table Of Contents, you will jump to the respective section.

If, for some reason, you don't want to install it, you can download a single
file [[https://github.com/snosov1/toc-org/blob/master/toc-org.el][toc-org.el]] manually, open it and call =M-x eval-buffer=.

Then change buffers to =README.org=. Subsequently, issue =M-x
toc-org-insert-toc= in the =README.org= buffer. If a new category of packages
has been added in your commit, the Table of Contents section will be revised and
updated.
