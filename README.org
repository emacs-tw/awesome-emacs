* Contributing

*Your contributions are always welcome!* Please submit a pull request or create an issue to add a new package, library or software to the list.

Before contributing, please read this tiny guideline:

** The Order of Items

*Please don't rearrange the package ordering without any reason!* The items should be sorted by its popularity ( /roughly, because it's impossible to have a precise standard./ e.g. _most people would use it_; _recommended for every newbie_...), instead of your personal preference.

For example, =Evil= is obviously not a package that every Emacser needs. So please don't move it onto the top of its category.

In contrast, if you think a package is recommended for every Emacser (especially for a newbie), just place it at a higher place in the list.

** Emacs Built-In Packages
If a package is available in the latest version of Emacs, please remember to add a =[built-in]= tag in the front of the description.

** Generate "Table of Contents"

It is recommended to install [[https://melpa.org/#/toc-org][toc-org]] that will update the Table Of Contents for
you automatically on each save. It will also give you a convenient navigation -
if you press =C-c C-o= (=org-open-at-point=) when the point is on the entry in
the Table Of Contents, you will jump to the respective section.

If, for some reason, you don't want to install it, you can download a single
file [[https://github.com/snosov1/toc-org/blob/master/toc-org.el][toc-org.el]] manually, open it and call =M-x eval-buffer=.

Then change buffers to =README.org=. Subsequently, issue =M-x
toc-org-insert-toc= in the =README.org= buffer. If a new category of packages
has been added in your commit, the Table of Contents section will be revised and
updated.
